--Mod Description--


This mod in a nutshell allows for coop out of the gate

Some features of the mod:
Able to summon as soon as you start the game. (Both on official servers and non!)
You no longer need embers since you become embered as soon as you spawn.
The multiplayer barriers are for the most part removed. (Theres one in High Wall where Emma is and one in catacombs of carthus)
Official Server support via Modengine 2! (Note: This mod WILL get you banned so play on an alt!)
Overleveled Phantom downscaling has been significantly reduced.

The mod is not seamless coop

Installation is simple!
Download the mod
Extract it
Drag the contents of the folder you just extracted into your game folder
Play!
(Additional setup required for DS3OS or Painted worlds, if you want to play with either of those 2 mods I will have tutorials posted in articles)

Note: I am not liable for any bans on your account. By you downloading this you're willingly accepting that your account could potentially get banned.

Note 2: This mod as of right now is finished. There is no further updates for this mod due to me having 0 ideas on how to achieve new features

If your mod doesnt work for you try setting loadlooseparams to 1 and modDirectoryOverride to "\Dark Souls 3 Co-Op Overhaul v5.03"
